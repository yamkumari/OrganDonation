		<h1>FAQs</h1>
		<br>
		<p><strong>* Why do people need transplants?</strong><br>

			People who need an organ transplant are usually very ill or dying because an organ is failing. They range from infants and children through to older people. People who need a tissue transplant can also be of any age. In some cases, tissue can save lives. More often, it greatly improves the recipient’s life.
		</p>
         <br>
         <p><strong>* Is there any alternative to organ transplants?</strong><br>

         	People in end-stage liver, heart or lung failure will die unless they have a transplant, while people with kidney failure can usually be placed on dialysis until a kidney becomes available. This requires them to have dialysis up to eight hours a day, several days a week.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p><strong>* How long people wait??</strong><br>

			The longer the delay, the greater is the risk. Waiting time can range between six months to four years but in some cases the recipients may wait for a longer time.
		</p>
		 <br>
         <p><strong>* Are all organs retrieved transplanted?</strong><br>

			Everything possible is done to make sure that the wish of the person is fulfilled. Family support/consent for organ donation plays an important role in organ and tissue donation. However, at the time of donation, sometimes organs intended for donation may not be medically suitable for transplant.
		</p>\

		<br>
         <p><strong>* Can I choose who gets my organs and tissues?</strong><br>

			Organs and tissues are allocated to transplant recipients in a fair, equitable process that takes no account of race, religion, gender, social status, disability or age – unless age is relevant to the organ matching criteria.

Waiting lists are managed by the respective state governments and follow the distribution guidelines of National Organ Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO). When a family consents to donate organs of their loved one, transplant coordinator passes the necessary information to the state government authority.

Criteria used in considering potential organ transplant recipients include:

How well the organs match the person
How long the person has been waiting for a transplant
How urgent the transplant is to be performed
Blood group, tissue type and size.
		</p>
		<br>
         <p><strong>* Is Transplantation always successful?</strong><br>

			Transplantation surgery is a complex procedure associated with some risks; however, majority of the recipients greatly benefit from it and lead full and active life. Many hospitals in India including some government hospitals are fully equipped to perform organ transplants.
